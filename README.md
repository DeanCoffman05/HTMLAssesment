#Lesson Learned 
Reverse engineering a projectis much more difficult than the design and development. This was an awesome oportunity to remember and work with something I hadn't in a long time. I  learned that CSS is an amazing tool to use along side HTML. The concepts of Objects and divisions were new to me and very much enjoyed. The ability to use a href to call different parts of the same .html file will prove to be very useful in the future. The <Style> tag has a huge level of versatility to tailor the design to your needs.
